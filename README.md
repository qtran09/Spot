# Spot
Spot is an Android mobile application that serves as a way to track a group of people's movements over a decently sized area and gauge the amount of area covered through the usage of Google Maps.
## Usage
Spot can be used in many ways. For example, a group of friends can use use Spot to eliminate previously searched locations in a simple game of hide-and-seek or scavenger. More importantly, Spot can be used as a way to manage a search party, keeping track of a group of people as they search for a target, whether it may be a missing person or a valuable object.
